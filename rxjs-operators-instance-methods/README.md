# Rxjs Operators Instance Methods

RxJS instance methods are functions that are available on observable objects in the RxJS library.
Observables are objects that represent a stream of values or events over time, and they have a number of instance methods that can be used to manipulate and work with those streams. 
Some examples of instance methods are:
